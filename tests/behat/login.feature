Feature: SAML Login
  In order to verify SimpleSAMLphp interacts with WordPress
  As a maintainer
  I need to use the examplepass provided by SimpleSAMLphp

  Scenario: Redirects between WordPress and SAML
    Given I am on "wp-login.php"
    Then print current URL
    And I fill in "username" with "employee"
    And I fill in "password" with "employeepass"
    And I press "submit"
    Then print current URL
    Then the "email" field should contain "test-em@example.com"

  Scenario: Redirects between WordPress and SAML student
    Given I am on "wp-login.php"
    Then print current URL
    And I fill in "username" with "student"
    And I fill in "password" with "studentpass"
    And I press "submit"
    Then print current URL
    Then the "email" field should contain "test-student@example.com"

  Scenario: Redirects using the 'redirect_to' field
    Given I am on "wp-login.php?redirect_to=/sample-page/"
    Then print current URL
    And I fill in "username" with "employee"
    And I fill in "password" with "employeepass"
    And I press "submit"
    Then print current URL
    Then I should see "Sample Page" in the ".wp-block-post-title" element

  Scenario: Errors on an invalidpassword
    Given I am on "wp-login.php"
    Then print current URL
    And I fill in "username" with "student"
    And I fill in "password" with "invalidpass"
    And I press "submit"
    Then print current URL
    And I should see "Incorrect username or password"
